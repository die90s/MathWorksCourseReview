# Project Description

This project explores a series of MathWorks self-paced learning modules intended to build practical engineering and computational skills using MATLAB and Simulink. It is based on modules accessed through the MathWorks Teaching Resources GitHub repository and official MathWorks Online Course platform. The content reviewed spans several major areas, including problem solving, simulation with Simulink, system architecture modeling, and machine learning for regression.

The goal of this project was to evaluate these modules from a student perspective, reflecting on their usefulness, engagement, structure, coding requirements, and content delivery.

# File Layout

The GitHub repository contains two files:

1. A single MATLAB Live Script that contains all of our combined reflections, evaluations, and analysis based on multiple MathWorks self-paced learning modules. All sections are clearly labeled using headers.

2. A read me file which provides an overview of the project, file contents, how to interact with the material, and a breakdown of collaboration between students.

# How to Interact With the Project

To view or interact with the project: Open MATLAB and open the .mlx file. Navigate through the different sections which are marked using headers. All sections contain structured written reflections and no additional scripts, data files, toolboxes, or folders are required.

# Methods and Content Evaluated

Two modules were reviewed which included:

1. Engineering and Problem Solving which focused on systems thinking, physical simulations (bungee jumping, drones), and modeling using Simulink.

2. Machine Learning for Regression where we used the Regression Learner App, examined feature engineering, model training, and advanced extensions including programmatic and deep learning.

Each module was accompanied by: reading accompanying materials, interacting with models and apps provided, testing simulations and visual outputs, and reflecting on learning value, ease of use, and educational structure.

# Breakdown of Student Contributions

Our team divided the work based on the two main modules we explored. Anna Kubrak and Diego Gonzalez primarily focused on the Machine Learning for Regression module, while Ashley Chiu and Ingrid Barrera concentrated on the Engineering Problem Solving module. Throughout the project, we all actively supported each other by sharing insights, discussing findings, and jointly exploring the MathWorks repositories. The project sections were clearly divided and assigned, but we maintained open communication to ensure consistency and comprehensive understanding.

Ashley took the lead in creating the final combined MATLAB Live Script integrating all individual contributions into one cohesive structured document. Ashley and Diego worked collaboratively on drafting and refining the README file, which provides an overview of the project and instructions.

Diego also took responsibility for setting up the GitHub repository and submitting the project.

# Notes
This project is intended to demonstrate engagement with educational tools and self-guided learning modules. All reflections and suggestions are based on first-hand exploration using MATLAB Online and accompanying teaching materials.
